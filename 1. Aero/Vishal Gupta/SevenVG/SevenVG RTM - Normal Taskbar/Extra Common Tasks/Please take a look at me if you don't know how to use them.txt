These are extra bonus files which can be used to show the "Common Tasks" at bottom or at left side of Windows Explorer.


Simply copy the "shellstyle.dll" file to any of following folders based upon the theme style you are using:

%windir%\Resources\Themes\SevenVG RTM Normal\Shell\NormalColor
%windir%\Resources\Themes\SevenVG RTM Normal\Shell\Aero48
%windir%\Resources\Themes\SevenVG RTM Normal\Shell\Basic32
%windir%\Resources\Themes\SevenVG RTM Normal\Shell\Basic48

Here %windir% means "Windows" directory present in the system drive where Windows XP installed in your system (most probably C: drive).


Remember that a "shellstyle.dll" file will already be present in above folders, so you'll need to replace the existing file.


If you face problem while replacing the file, do any of the following:

1. Rename existing "shellstyle.dll" file to some other name and then copy the new DLL file. Restart or log off the system and Windows will start using this new shellstyle.

2. Or first apply default Luna theme from Desktop Properties and then replace the shellstyle.dll file. Now re-apply "SevenVG RTM Normal" theme.
