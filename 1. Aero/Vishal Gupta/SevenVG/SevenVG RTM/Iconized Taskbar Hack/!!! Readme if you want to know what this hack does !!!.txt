This hack will change Taskbar buttons size and Windows will only show running program icon and will hide the text. That's what we call "Iconized Taskbar". Windows 7 does the same thing.


To apply the hack:
==================

Run "Install.reg" file and log off or restart your system.


To restore default settings:
============================

Run "Uninstall.reg" file and log off or restart your system.
