# XP Theme Collection

This is a collection of Windows XP themes that I have collected over the years. They are tested on Windows XP Service Pack 3, although they may work on earlier versions. Actually, why would you use earlier versions? SP3 is the best one anyway...

## Credits

URLs to the theme pages are available in [CREDITS.txt](./CREDITS.txt)

## Prerequisites

You need to have either the Universal Theme Patcher or Styler installed to use these themes.

I prefer the Universal Theme Patcher because it enables the Windows Preferences Dialog to render these themes properly.

You can find the Universal Theme Patcher at this link: https://universal-theme-patcher.en.lo4d.com/windows

You can find Styler at this link: https://m.majorgeeks.com/files/details/styler.html

## License

There is no license for this archive because I did not create these themes.
